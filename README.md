# General front-end
>  A general repository that contains many projects (even the basics from 2017) that I've managed to save on my computer before known git, also newer front-end stuff

## What kinda tech will be here?
University projects _without that much matter_, exercises, small projects and everything **not too much important** to open a new repository that has matter on: `html`, `css`, `javascript`, `typescript`, `react`, `next.js`, `vue`, `svelte` and anything related.

_Pretty much straightforward, regular front-end stuff._
